					<h3>Virginia Landmarks Register</h3>
					<img class="align-left frame" src="./images/vdhr_logo.jpeg"
						width="150" /><BR> The Virginia Landmarks Register was
					established in 1966 and is managed by the Department of Historic
					Resources. It is the state’s official list of properties important
					to Virginia’s history. The same criteria are used to evaluate
					resources for inclusion in the state register as are used for the
					National Register. Listing on the VDHR Virginia Landmarks Register
					is a prerequisite for inclusion on the National Register. When a
					property is placed on the Virginia Landmarks Register, it is
					certification that it meets all requirements for inclusion on the
					National Register.
					<P>Inclusion on the Virginia Landmarks Register or owning a
						property that qualifies in a recognized historic district entitles
						the owners to Virginia State tax credits when investing in
						stabilization, preservation and restoration efforts.
					<P>The Department of Historic Resources (DHR) and National Park
						Service (NPS) do not charge any fees for any part of the
						registration process. Costs may be incurred for items such as
						maps, postage, photo prints, photocopies, and other materials the
						author includes with the nomination packet. Many property owners
						successfully complete the Preliminary Information Forms and
						National Register of Historic Places nominations with advice from
						department staff.
					<P>Members of Preservation Northern Shenandoah Valley are ready
						to assist you and answer questions that you may have for getting
						your priceless treasure or your proposed historic district
						nominated for inclusion on the Virginia Landmarks Register. Just
						visit our Contact Us page, select "VDHR &amp;amp; NRHP forms" from
						the drop down list and fill in your message.

						Nomination Processes page at the VDHR website to learn about the
						two-step process for getting your property recognized.<BR>Please

					<h3>National Register of Historic Places</h3>
					<img class="align-left frame" src="./images/logo_nrhp.jpg"
						width="150" /><BR> The National Register of Historic Places
					is the official list of the Nation's historic places worthy of
					preservation. Authorized by the National Historic Preservation Act
					of 1966, the National Park Service's National Register of Historic
					Places is part of a national program to coordinate and support
					public and private efforts to identify, evaluate, and protect
					America's historic and archeological resources.
					<P>The Virginia Department of Historic Resources is the State
						Historic Preservation Office(SHPO) for Virginia. It receives
						National Register nominations and provides feedback to the
						nominating individual or group. After preliminary review, the SHPO
						sends each nomination to the state's historic review commission,
						which then recommends whether the State Historic Preservation
						Officer should send the nomination to the Keeper of the National
						Register. For any non-Federally owned property, only the State
						Historic Preservation Officer may officially nominate a property
						for inclusion in the National Register. After the nomination is
						recommended for listing in the National Register by the SHPO, the
						nomination is sent to the National Park Service, which approves or
						denies the nomination.
