					<h1>Our Work</h1>


					<!-- main text of the page goes here -->
					<P>Preservation Northern Shenandoah Valley has been an
						effective advocate for preservation efforts in our community. This
						advocacy has led to the successful rescue of significant buildings
						slated for demolition, raised funds for the stabilization of
						endangered properties, and led to establishing good working
						relationships with various governments in our 5 county area.

						<h2>Lord Fairfax Land Office Stabilization</h2>
						<P>One of the earliest efforts of PNSV was working to raise
							funds for the stabilization of Thomas Lord Fairfax's Greenway
							Court Land Office and carriage house in White Post, Clarke
							County, Virginia. PNSV was successful in raising $48,000 from
							local patrons for this important work. PNSV transferred the funds
							to the Clarke County Historical Society who is overseeing this
							important project.</P>
						<P>Thomas, the 6th Lord Fairfax was master of the Scotland
							Proprietary of the Northern Neck of Virginia, a vast tract of
							land covering over 6 million acres. The only British Peer to
							establish residence in America, Lord Fairfax issued countless
							land grants to settlers throughout Northern Virginia. Greenway
							Court was where he lived and transacted his affairs.

						<h2>Hohenheim - Saved from demolition</h2>
						<P>The survival of this circa 1890's Gothic Revival farmhouse
							can be attributed directly to PNSV's advocacy efforts at the
							local government level. In 2005, Georgetown University purchased
							the 55-acre farm property with the intention of building a
							student retreat center. and planned to demolish the house. PNSV
							officials met with County staff, spoke at the public hearing
							before the Board of Supervisors, and met with officials from the
							University. Ultimately, we were successful in convincing the
							Board of Supervisors of Clarke County to grant approval of the
							special use permit for the retreat center with the condition that
							the house would be saved.
						<P>Hohenheim is a Gothic Revival farmhouse, located on the
							ridgeline of the Blue Ridge Mountains in Clarke County, near
							Snicker’s Gap. The house was built in 1893 by Charles G. Smith,
							Sr., the founder of Potomac Stone Company (later Columbia Granite
							and Dredging Company). The name “Hohenheim” means “high home” in
							German.

						<h2>Millbank House - Saved from demolition</h2>
						<P>The survival of this circa 1830's Greek Revival farmhouse
							can be attributed directly to PNSV's advocacy efforts at the
							local government level. The house was occupied until 1984, when
							the Frederick Winchester Service Authority acquired the property
							for the Opequon Water Reclamation Facility. After years of
							demolition by neglect, they announced plans to demolish the
							property in 2009.
						<P>Millbank House served as a hospital for wounded Union
							troops after the 3rd Battle of Winchester. This history led a
							coalition of local and regional preservation groups, including
							the Fort Collier Civil War Center, the Kernstown Battlefield
							Association, the Shenandoah Valley Battlefields Foundation, the
							Civil War Preservation Trust, the Virginia Department of Historic
							Resources and the Northern Shenandoah Valley branch of
							Preservation Virginia (now Preservation Northern Shenandoah
							Valley), to develop and present the Service Authority with a plan
							to save the building.
						<P>The Service Authority agreed and transferred ownership of
							the house to the Fort Collier Civil War Center. The house is now
							awaiting restoration.
